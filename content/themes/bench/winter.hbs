                <h2>Winter Activation Ideas for Main Streets &amp; Neighbordhoods During COVID19</h2>
                <p>As COVID19 restrictions and public safety concerns limit indoor activities, restaurants, events,
                    social
                    gatherings and more have turned to the outdoors. This has been great during the Spring and Summer
                    but
                    will become challenging during the colder, darker winter months. “Winter Streets &amp;
                    Neighborhoods” is
                    soliciting input from main streets, municipalities, CDCs and others as to what their needs are for
                    their
                    stakeholders during the coming winter months.</p>

                    and
                    businesses. Final designs will then be published in a “Winter Streets &amp; Neighborhoods”
