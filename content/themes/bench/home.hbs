        The bench appears ordinary... found in many forms in often overlooked and ignored spaces. At Bench Consulting we
        help you unlock the potential in the ordinary. We are dedicated to helping communities take a second look at
        neglected, underused spaces and work with everyday users to unlock the power of these places. Powerful change
        through the connection of people, place and ideas.
        Meet us at bench and let's start a conversation.
